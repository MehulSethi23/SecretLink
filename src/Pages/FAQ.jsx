              Sharing secrets is delicate. You don't want sensitive information
              (confidential information, passwords, API keys, access tokens, key
              combinations, confessions, etc.) to stay in your Slack channel,
              Whatsapp chat log, inbox, or any other communication channel. A
              one-time disposable link guarantees that your secret is only
              viewed exactly once, before being permanently destroyed.

              After you submit the form your secret will be encrypted and
              stored. You can now share the generated short link via text
              message, email or whatever service you trust. (We recommend
              Signal, Threema or Matrix.) After the recipients clicks the link,
              the message gets displayed and permanently removed from the
              database. <br />
              <br />
              For <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>extra security</span>,
              you can include a password that will be needed to decrypt the
              message. (We recommend to share the password via a different
              channel than the link.)

              All messages are end-to-end encrypted using AES-256, which is
              virtually impenetrable using brute-force methods. AES would take
              billions of years to break using current computing technology. For
              the highest level of security, an optional password (which is
              never stored either) will be used to encrypt your message.

              Nope. It's a one time secret. We show it once and then delete it

              good.
